# Install
Edit your splits and click activate for the auto splitter

## If that doesnt work:
MuddyHeights2.asl requires asl-help to work. Download it [here](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/raw/main/lib/asl-help) and then put it in your LiveSplits components folder. Add a ScriptableAutoSplitter to your split layout and point it to MuddyHeights2.asl. If everything works then this will be the same as activating it through LiveSplits.
